# My Story
I am an engineering student, I started my college journey in September of 2024. I always wanted to write a blog or a newsletter to funnel my thoughts (rants) into it. But it has been a struggle to say the least.

I have been meaning to build a personal blog for a very long time. I have had many designs and re-desings of said blog/article I tried various desgin styles types and tech stacks but nothing suited my needs. So I decided to just stick with a blog template. I do wish to build my own blog with all the design and development from the ground up.

Peace <3
